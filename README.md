# Air Predictior

Prototype for an app that would be meant for prediction of AQI in certain cities. Now it basically loads already predicted data (which was achieved using Tensorflow Probability model) and visualizes it. On top of that we have (almost) real time info about current state of air quality in desired city.

## Run Project

In the project directory run:

### `npm install`

This will install all necessary dependencies. Be patient it will take a while.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
